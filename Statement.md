PROBLEM STATEMENT: In a lot of games and digital environments, dice are used for random outcomes. Using physical dice is not feasible in such digital environments, hence this simulation of a dice helps the user to accurately generate dice values, use the dice multiple times. 
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT: This simulation can be used in varipus digital gaming environments. 
TARGET USERS: Students and beginners in programming, Teachers and Educators, Game Developers and fame Enthusiasts.
HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES: Uses Pyhton modules, condition statements, loops.
